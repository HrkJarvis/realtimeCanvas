# My Development Prompts

This document contains the prompts I used during development of my realtime collaborative canvas application.

## Nov 17, 2025 - Project Setup

**My Prompt**: "Help me design and implement a realtime collaborative canvas using React (Vite) and Node.js with Socket.io. Key features needed: infinite canvas with pan/zoom, drawing tools (pen, shapes), shareable room URLs, realtime synchronization, and per-user undo/redo functionality."

## Nov 17, 2025 - Canvas Drawing Features

**My Prompt**: "Need help implementing drawing tools - pen for freehand drawing, rectangle and ellipse tools. Also need to implement proper pan and zoom functionality with mouse controls."

## Nov 17, 2025 - Realtime Sync Implementation

**My Prompt**: "How should I structure Socket.io events for real-time canvas collaboration? Need to handle element creation, updates, deletion, and room management."

## Nov 17, 2025 - Per-User Undo/Redo System

**My Prompt**: "Implementing undo/redo system that only affects the current user's actions, not other users' drawings. Need guidance on action history management."

## Nov 18, 2025 - Image Feature Implementation

**My Prompt**: "Adding image upload and manipulation features to the canvas. Need help with drag-and-drop, resizing handles, and selection tool implementation."

## Nov 18, 2025 - Feature Refactoring

**My Prompt**: "Removing image upload features to simplify the application. Also need to clean up the selection tool and related code."
